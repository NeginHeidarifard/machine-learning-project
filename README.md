# Variational Autoencoder Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** using Python and PyTorch. The project explores how VAEs can be used for dimensionality reduction, data generation, and representation learning.

## Project Files
- **`variational-autoencoder-implementation.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook with the code for training and evaluating the VAE.
- **`VAE_project_report.pdf`**: A detailed report explaining the theory behind Variational Autoencoders, the approach used, results, and conclusions.

## Overview
- The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and results visualization.
- The report provides an in-depth explanation of the methodology, including loss functions like the Kullback-Leibler Divergence and Reconstruction Loss.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NeginHeidarifard/variational-autoencoder-implementation.git
